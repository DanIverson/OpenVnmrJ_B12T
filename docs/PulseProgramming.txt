Overview of Pulse Programming
=============================

Pulse sequences are written in C, a high-level programming 
language that allows considerable sophistication in the way 
pulse sequences are created and executed. A new pulse 
sequence is written as a C function called pulsesequence. 
The file containing this function is compiled and linked with 
an object library that contains the definitions for all 
pulse-sequence statements, the PSG. 
A compiled C sequence is executed on the Linux workstation 
at the start of acquisition, so-called run-time. At 
run-time, the sequence reads values from a parameter table and 
constructs a second real-time program of acodes, whose 
purpose will be to run the SpinCore controller board.

The PSG library contains C code to run the pulsesequence
function and to run spectra corresponding to arrays of parameter 
values. The user need not program these loops explicitly. 
At the start of the acquisition, all of the variables and 
statements of the compiled C program, including the C loops 
and conditionals, are resolved and fixed into acodes, without 
the possibility of further input or calculation. A complex 
program with many choices, using the C if-else-endif
statement, may resolve into a very few acodes, because the 
acodes in the non-selected branches are never created. A 
pulse program with multidimensional looping and/or 
parameter arrays will produce a separate set of acodes for 
every increment.

The real-time acode program is automatically looped over 
the number of scans for each multidimensional increment or 
array element. Special real-time integer tables, t1 to t10,
are used to increment phases and other values that might change 
scan-to-scan. These tables and variables are initialized and 
manipulated by special pulse-sequence statements, the 
real-time math statements. 

Writing pulse sequences
=========================

Pulse sequence text files are stored in a directory named psglib
in either the system directory ( /vnmr/psglib) or in a user directory 
( /home/vnmr1/vnmrsys/psglib for the user vnmr1). A 
pulse sequence file has the extension .c to indicate that it 
contains C language source code. Pulse sequences may also 
be saved in the psglib directory of an applications directory,
which may have any name and path. An 
applications directory is made accessible through the Edit 
Applications tool of the Files pull down menu.
A pulse sequence text file can be modified using the Linux 
tool vi, the standard Linux editor gedit, or by an available 
text editor or development package. 

The template for all pulse sequences is:

#include "standard.h"

void pulsesequence()
{
  // Pulse elements

}

Since it is a C function, any C construction may be used. The available
pulse elements are described below. For examples, see the pulse sequences
in /vnmr/psglib

Compiling pulse sequences
=========================

After writing a pulse sequence, the source code is compiled by one of the 
following methods:
  By entering seqgen(filename<.c>) on the OpenVnmrJ command line.
  By entering seqgen on the OpenVnmrJ command line, with seqfil='filename'
  By entering seqgen filename<.c> from a Linux shell

For example, enter seqgen('s2pul') to compile the s2pul.c 
sequence in OpenVnmrJ. A full path is not necessary 
from the command line. Alternatively, you can enter
  seqgen s2pul
from in a Linux shell. The seqgen command will first search the
user, then the available applications directories, and then the
system for a file with a .c extension. 

During compilation, the system performs the following steps:
1.  Extensions are added to the pulse sequence to allow a 
    graphical display of the sequence, using the dps command. 
2.  The source code is checked for syntax, variable consistency,
    and the correct usage of functions.
3.  The source code is converted into compiled object code.
4.  If the conversion is successful, the object code is 
    combined with the necessary system PSG object libraries 
    ( libparam.so and libpsglib.so), to be linked at 
    run-time. If the compilation of the pulse sequence with 
    the dps extensions fails, the pulse sequence is recompiled 
    without the dps extensions. 

The executable code is stored in the user seqlib directory 
(for example, /home/vnmr1/vnmrsys/seqlib). If the user does 
not have a seqlib directory, it is automatically created. A 
copy of the source code is also saved in vnmrsys/seqlib
 of the user directory. If desired, you can copy the compiled
sequence to /vnmr/seqlib or to the seqlib directory in an 
applications directory. 
Standard compiled sequences are supplied in /vnmr/seqlib
 and the source code for each of these sequences is found in 
/vnmr/psglib. To recompile one of 
these sequences or to modify it, first copy the sequence into 
the user psglib, make the required modifications, and then 
recompile the sequence using seqgen. Sequences can only be 
compiled from a user directory. If you attempt to compile a 
system sequence, a local copy will be created. The 
seqgenupdate command performs a seqgen as the first step, 
and will then attempt to move the resulting seqlib entries 
back to the application directory from which they were 
taken.

The source files that are used to create the PSG object 
library are contained in the system directory /vnmr/psg.
In principle, a user can customize and recompile the PSG 
source files, but most users do not do so. It is easier to add 
the user source code in a separate file using the standard C 
#include statement. User #include files should be stored in 
the ~/vnmrsys/psg directory of a user or an applications 
directory. 


Pulse Elements
==============

Pulse sequences are constructed from pulse elements, which specify
controls for the NMR hardware. The "C-style" signature for these
elements is defined below.

void delay(double time)
   Delay for "time" seconds. If 0.0 is passed, the delay is ignored.
   The minimum delay time is about 67 ns.
   Examples:
      delay(0.1);
      delay(d1);
      delay(d2/2.0);


void pulse(double time, int phase)
   Turn on the RF for duration of "time" seconds with the RF phase set to the
   value of the "phase" argument. A delay of "rof1" is done prior to turning
   on the RF pulse to allow the amplifier to switch on. A delay of "rof2" is
   done following the pulse to allow for probe ring-down.
   Examples:
      pulse(p1,zero);
      pulse(pw,oph);
      pulse(pw,PH90);
      pulse(pw,t1);

void rgpulse(double time, int phase, double rg1, double rg2)
   Turn on the RF for duration of "time" seconds with the RF phase set to the
   value of the "phase" argument. A delay of rg1 is done prior to turning
   on the RF pulse to allow the amplifier to switch on. A delay of rg2 is
   done following the pulse to allow for probe ring-down.
   rgpulse(p1,zero,rof1,rof2) is equivalent to pulse(p1,zero).
   Examples:
      rgpulse(pw,oph,rof1,rof2);
      rgpulse(p1,zero,rof1,0.0);
      rgpulse(pw,PH90,1e-6,0.0);
      rgpulse(pw,t1,1e-6,rof2);

void offset(double frequency)  // Not yet implemented
  Offset the RF frequency to the supplied value.

void acquire(double datapnts, double dwell)
   Start acquiring data points. The number of data points is defined
   by the np parameter. The dwell period to acquire one complex pair is 1/sw.
   A delay of alfa is done prior to the acquire to account for filter
   delays. If a pulse sequence does not include an acquire pulse element,
   one will be automatically added at the end of the sequence.
   Examples:
      acquire(np, 1.0/sw);

void power(double amp)
  Control the power of the amplifier during an RF pulse. The supplied
  amp can be in the range of 0.0 (no power) to 100.0 (full power).
  The power adjustment uses the pulse shaping capability of the SpinCore
  board. The power controls the amplitude of a rectangular shaped pulse.
  Only four power levels can be used, one of which is the full power
  pulse.

void settable(int table, int cnt, int phases[])
  The "table" argument is one of the phase table names t1-t10.
  The "cnt" argument is the number of phase elements to be assigned
  to the phase table. It is the number of elements in the array specified
  by the third argument.  The phases[] arguemnt is a pre-defined array
  of phase elements. For an example, see the "Phase cycling" section.

void status(int state)
  Controls the on/off state of the microwave source. The microwave source
  is selected by the systemglobal bnc, which can be set with the config
  program to BNC0 or BNC1. The parameter xm controls the on/off state.
  It can have multiple states: status(A) sets the status described by
  the first letter of the xm parameter, status(B) uses the second letter,
  etc. If a pulse sequence has more status statements than there are
  letters in the xm parameter, control reverts back to the last letter
  of the parameter value. For example, xm='nyn' will turn the microwave
  source off during status A, on during status B, and off during
  status C. Any status higher than C (D-Z) will select the final character
  of the xm string (n) and turn the microwave source off.

  The states do to need to increase monotonically during a pulse
  sequence. One can write a pulse sequence that starts with status(A),
  goes later to status(B), returns to status(A) and then goes to status(C).
  Example:
     status(A);
     delay(d1);
     status(B);

   will turn the microwave source on during the d1 delay if xm='yn'
   It will turn the microwave source off during the d1 delay if xm='nn'
  
void getstr(const char *variable, char buf[])
void getstrnwarn(const char *variable, char buf[])
  Get the value of a string parameter. The first argument is the name
  of the string parameter and the second argument is a character array
  of length MAXSTR. If the parameter does not exist, a null
  string is returned. The getstr() element will give a warning if the
  parameter does not exist. The getstrnwarn() will not give a
  warning if the parameter does not exist.
  Example:
     char myFlag[MAXSTR];
     getstr("flag", myFlag);

double getval(const char *variable)
double getvalnwarn(const char *variable)
  Get the value of a real valued parameter. The argument is the name
  of the parameter.  If the parameter does not exist, a 0.0
  is returned. The getval() element will give a warning if the
  parameter does not exist. The getvalnwarn() will not give a
  warning if the parameter does not exist.
  Example:
     double myVal = getval("val");


Phase Cycling
=============


There are several phase variables that control the phase of RF pulses
and the phase of the receiver. These are
  zero, one, two, three
  t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, and t10
  oph

The constants PH0, PH90, PH160, PH270 are used to select the 0, 90, 180,
and 270 degree phase. The constants ZERO, ONE, TWO, and THREE similarly
represent the 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree phase. These are present for
compatibility with Varian/Agilent pulse sequences.

There are also phase tables t1-t10 and oph. These tables may contain any
number of phase elements. The particular element used is determined by
the current transient (CT) being acquired. The tranisients increment from
0 to (nt-1) where nt is the total number of transients.

The zero, one, two, and three phase variables are initialized to ZERO,
ONE, TWO, and THREE, respectively. The oph phase table controls the
phase of the receiver.  It is initialized to the four values
{ZERO,ONE,TWO,THREE}, which represents the "cyclops" phase cycle.
The t1-t10 tables are only used if they are defined
by the pulse sequence.
The cp parameter (cycle phase) is typically set to 'y'. If it is set to 'n',
the cycling of the receiver phase (oph) is turned off. That is, only the
first element of the oph table is used. This is usually only used
during FID shimming and wobble.

The second argument to the pulse element is the phase. For example,
  pulse(pw, zero);
That second argument can to zero, one, two, or three. Equivalently,
it can be PH0, PH90, PH180, or PH270.
It can also be oph, in which case the phase of the pulse tracks the receiver
phase. Phase tables t1-t10 can also be used. As an example

static int ph1 = {PH0, PH180, PH90, PH270};

void pulsesequence()
{
   ...

   settable(t1,4,ph1);

   pulse(pw,t1);

}

By setting oph to a table, one can alter the receiver phase.
   settable(oph,4,ph1);


Pulse Sequence Parameters
=========================

The following parameters are used by all pulse sequences.

The global parameters do not exist and the defaults are the
normal values. 

B12_BoardNum - global parameter specifying the SpinCore board number.
               default is 0

B12_BypassFIR - global parameter specifying whether to bypass the
                SpinCore FIR filter.
                default is 1

B12_ADC - global parameter specifying the SpinCore ADC frequency
          in MHz. default is 75.0

mps - set the state of the MPS when the experiment starts. At the end
      of the experiment, the state of the MPS will be returned
      to its original state. The mps parameter can be set to one
      of four values.
        manual - leave the MPS in the state it has been manually set to.
        off    - turn the MPS off ( rfstatus=0 )
        on     - turn the MPS on ( wgstatus=1 rfstatus=1 )
        ext    - turn the MPS to ext state ( wgstatus=1 rfstatus=2 )
      If mps='manual' and the MPS is set in the "EXT" state or
      if mps='ext', then pulse sequences will be able to control the 
      MPS with the status() pulse element. Also, the mpspower parameter
      will be active. The default value for mps is 'ext'.

Experiment parameters used by all pulse sequences include:

exppath - the path name of the experiment where data will be stored.
          This is normally set when one does a "jexp" or join experiment.

arraydim - The total number of FIDs to be acquired for this experiment.
           This parameter is automatically set when one arrays
           a parameter.

sfrq  - base frequency of the RF channel. This is normally a calculated
        value based on the selected nucleus (tn), the lockfreq, and any
        additional offset (tof).

np - the number of points in an acquired FID (total points, sum of reals
     and imaginaries). Number of complex pairs is np/2.

mpspower - the power of the MPS. Range is 0-60. If mpspower=-1, the MPS
           will be set to the "OFF" state. The mpspower parameter is only
           active if mps='ext' or if mps='manual' and the MPS unit has been
           manually set to the "EXT" state.

nt - number of transients

sw - spectral width, in Hz.

tpwrf - amplitude of an RF pulse. Values range from 100.0 (full power)
        to 0.0 (no power). If tpwrf does not exist, or if it is set
        to "Not used" (tpwrf='n'),  full power hard pulses are used.
        If tpwrf is set to a number between 0 and 100, the "shaped
        pulse" feature of the SpinCore board is used. The shape is a
        rectangular shape and tpwrf controls the amplitude of this
        shape. This allows for less than full power pulses.

rattn - controls the additional "Receiver attenuator" hardware. If
        rattn does not exist or is set to "Not used" (rattn='n'),
        then no instructions are sent to the additional attenuator.
        If rattn is a value between 0 and 120, then that value is
        sent to the attenuator. Setting rattn=0 means no attenuation
        of the incoming signal. Setting rattn=120 means adding 120 dBm
        of attenuation to the incoming signal.

rof1 - time prior to an RF pulse to allow for the amplifier turnon time.

rof2 - time following an RF pulse. Often reflects probe ringdown
       time.

alfa - delay prior to acquiring data. Often used to account for filter
       group delay.

cp - cycle phase, controls the behavior of the oph phase table. For
     cp='y', the oph phase table uses all elements of the table.
     If cp='n', only the first element of the table is used.

array - used to determine what parameters, if any, are arrayed.

ni - number of increments in the first indirect dimension. This
     identifies a 2D experiment.

ix - current increment. It's values will range from 1 to arraydim.
     It can be used to select alternate sequences for an arrayed
     experiment. For example, to acquire data where every other
     FID has the microwave source turned on, one could do something
     like the following.

     if (ix % 2)
        status(A);
     else
        status(B);

Other parameter associated with a pulse sequence are used within the
pulse sequence itself. For example, the s2pul.c pulse sequence uses

d1 - relaxation delay prior to the first pulse
p1 - pulse width of the first pulse
d2 - delay between the first and second pulse
pw - pulse width of the second pulse

If custom parameters are defined for a pulse sequence, their values
may be obtained with the getval() and getstr() pulse elements.


Processing parameters

wexp - specify action to take at the completion of the data acquisition.
werr - specify action to take if an error occurs during data acquisition.


ACODE generation
================

When the OpenVnmrJ "go" command is executed, the parameter seqfil is used to
select the pulse sequence to execute. For example, if seqfil='s2pul', then
a binary file named s2pul is looked for in ~/vnmrsys/seqlib and /vnnmr/seqlib.
If it is found, it is started and the parameters from the "joined" experiment,
along with the global parameters are sent to the s2pul binary. The s2pul program
then generates a set of acodes, based on the parameters and the details of the
pulsesequence function. The acodes are keyword - value pairs. For example, running
s2pul with just a single transient (nt=1) may generate a set of acodes such as

Phase cycling is handled by incrementing the index used when accessing the phase tables. Note that the
actual phase tables are not included in the acodes. Only the values of the indexed phase tables are in the
acodes. To avoid multiple copies of the acodes where the only differences are the phase values, the PSG
first scans the pulse sequence to determine the longest phase cycle used, and then uses the SpinCore
looping mechanism to loop over the pulse elements the proper number of times. To illustrate, the following
are the acodes for s2pul with nt=10. The longest phase cycle used by s2pul is 4 for the receiver (oph)
phase cycle. The acodes loop twice over four transients and then the remaining two transients follow.
Acodes with no comments are the same as for the seqfil='s2pul' and  nt=1 case.

ACODE interpretation
====================

When the go command is executed, it generates the acode file as described
above and a second file used by "the procs" to handle experiment queueing
and monitoring. When the controlling Expproc determines that it is time
to start an experiment, it checks its queue and starts B12proc, passing the
name of the acode file to use. The B12proc progrm reads the acode file
line by line.  Each keyword causes some action. Some keywords, such as
BOARD_NUMBER, BLANK_BIT, BYPASS_FIR, ADC_FREQUENCY, FILE, NUMBER_POINTS,
NUMBER_OF_SCANS, SPECTRAL_WIDTH, and POWER just set parameters.
Other keywords cause SpinCore elements to be executed. The PULSEPROG_START
acode causes the SpinCore initialization functions to be called. It also
initializes the internal current transient (ct) counter. The PULSE_ELEMENTS
acode calls the pb_start_programming(PULSE_PROGRAM) SpinCore function.
The PULSEPROG_DONE acode calls the pb_stop_programming() function and also
uses the pb_get_data() function to collect the data from the SpinCore
board and save it to a file defined by the FILE keyword. Other keywords,
such as DELAY, PULSE, and ACQUIRE cause appropriate pb_inst_radio_shape()
functions to be called .

Hardware control
================

The SpinCore board has four TTL lines, named Flag0 to Flag3. They have been
assigned the following functions.

Flag0: Trigger line to the MPS if the "mps" parameter is set to "ext"
       It is triggered by the status pulse element when the xm parameter
       for that status period is 'y'.

Flag1: This controls the receiver unblanking. It goes high after the alfa
       delay when the SpinCore board is triggered to start data acquisition.

Flag2: This controls the amplifier unblanking. It goes high at the beginning
       of the rof1 delay prior to turning on the RF. It goes low after the
       RF is turned off.

Flag3: The controls setting the system into tune mode for RF turning.
       It goes high at the beginning of the "mtune" process and goes low
       when "mtune" completes. There is a delay of d1 duration prior to
       the start of the RF tuning process where Flag3 is also high. This
       gives the system time to switch into tune mode.


The "receiver attenuator" is a USB device controlled by the
/vnmr/bin/mcl_RUDAT command. The range of values is 0 to 120 in 0.25 steps.
One can set the attenuator directly from a terminal with the command
/vnmr/bin/mcl_RUDAT <value>
The attenuator is controlled from a pulse sequence with the rattn parameter.
